# Snake TDD workshop
The purpose of this practice is to build the classic Snake game in JS applying the TDD technique.

All tests are already written so people (preferably in groups) have to implement the code to make them pass.

The idea is that people are focused on resolving the logic problems without changing the context of code and terminal windows. Yes, it's a game, but we'll program it without opening a browser window.

Once the time is finished or people have the logic implemented, we'll pass to the next step.

### Rules
1. Don't modify tests.
2. Divide your screen to watch code and tests at the same time.
3. Be polite and patient with your partners

### Getting ready
You'll need node version 8 installed. You can switch between node's version with [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

Once you have the right version of node, just intall clone the repository and create a local branch.

```
git checkout -b my-solution origin/master
```

Then install dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Running tests
```
npm test
```
Hoever we encourage to use the `watch` version to launch tests automatically every time a file is updated.

```
npm run test-watch
```

### Next step?
Comming soon...
